<p>A <b>scramjet</b> (<i><b>s</b>upersonic <b>c</b>ombusting <b>ramjet</b></i>) is a variant of a <a href="/wiki/Ramjet" title="Ramjet">ramjet</a> <a href="/wiki/Airbreathing_jet_engine" title="Airbreathing jet engine">airbreathing jet engine</a> in which combustion takes place in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supersonic" title="Supersonic">supersonic</a> airflow. As in ramjets, a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress the incoming air before combustion (hence <i>ram</i>jet), but a ramjet decelerates the air to <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_sound" title="Speed of sound">subsonic</a> velocities before combustion, while airflow in a scramjet is supersonic throughout the entire engine. This allows the scramjet to operate efficiently at extremely high speeds.</p>
