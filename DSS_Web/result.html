The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent ("polytonic"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/h/</span> sound, and the <a href="/wiki/Iota_subscript" title="Iota subscript">iota subscript</a> for the final historical <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/i/</span> sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to a monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the <a href="/wiki/Acute_accent" title="Acute accent">acute accent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic)" title="Diaeresis (diacritic)">diaeresis</a>.</p>
